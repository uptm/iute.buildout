Description: Introduction
        ============
        This package is used for placing utilities that can be
        used across all iute plone projects.
        
        For instance, there are many helper functions that make
        normal plone type things much more simple and easier to
        read.
        
        For instance, to install dependencies for a product,
        from iute.core.utils import install
        install.these(['iute.default']).dependencies()
        
        Much easier to do and read isn't it?
        
        Take a look at the code to see how it is done.
        
        
        
        Using iute_tools object in a product
        ==============
        First off, make this package a dependency.
        
        In the configure.zcml of your package do this,
        
        >>> <include package="iute.core" />
        
        This will make sure the iute_tools is registered
        
        Now in code you can do something like,
        
        >>> iute_tools = getMultiAdapter((self.context, self.request), name=u'iute_tools')
        
        Or in a tal expression you can do something like this,
        
        >>> python:portal.restrictedTraverse('@@iute_tools')
