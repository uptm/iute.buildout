Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A fork package from uwosh.themebase for IUTE Website
        
        This product provides the base functionality that all other IUTE plone sites should use.
        
        
        Using the random images
        -----------------------
        
        For the images to show up on the site, you need to add a folder with the id 'main-images' and then add your images there.  This folder can be overridden at any place in the site, so you can have a different set of random images show up in different places.
        
        
        Live Search
        ===========
        To enable the livesearch to work along with google search of all campus sites, I customized the livesearch.js file which is located
        in the skins directory.
        
        I dynamically bind and unbind search keys.
